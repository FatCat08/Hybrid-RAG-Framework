History Information:
--------------------
The No.1 subquestion is `What are the films directed by [William Wyler]?`,and the answer is `answer:

The Liberation of L.B. Jones|Roman Holiday|The Children's Hour|Dodsworth|Counsellor at Law|The Desperate Hours|Ben-Hur|The Big Country|How to Steal a Million|Come and Get It`
The No.2 subquestion is `What are the genres of the films "The Liberation of L.B. Jones", "Roman Holiday", "The Children's Hour", "Dodsworth", "Counsellor at Law", "The Desperate Hours", "Ben-Hur", "The Big Country", "How to Steal a Million", and "Come and Get It"?`,and the answer is `I'm unable to provide the genres of the films based on the given information due to a syntax error in the SQL query. 

The error indicates that the query structure is incorrect, particularly near the "s" character in the string. This is likely due to improperly escaped characters or syntax issues in the SQL query.

To resolve this, the query needs to be corrected and re-run. Here's an example of a corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT has_genre FROM table_0 WHERE movie LIKE '%The Liberation of L.B. Jones%' 
OR movie LIKE '%Roman Holiday%' 
OR movie LIKE '%The Children''s Hour%' 
OR movie LIKE '%Dodsworth%' 
OR movie LIKE '%Counsellor at Law%' 
OR movie LIKE '%The Desperate Hours%' 
OR movie LIKE '%Ben-Hur%' 
OR movie LIKE '%The Big Country%' 
OR movie LIKE '%How to Steal a Million%' 
OR movie LIKE '%Come and Get It%'
```

Note the use of double single quotes to escape the apostrophe in "The Children's Hour".

To get the genres, the corrected query needs to be executed in the database, or alternatively, if you have access to another source or database, you can manually look up the genres for these films.`

Original Question:

The No.1 subquestion is `What are the movies starred by [Cornel Wilde]?`,and the answer is `answer:

California Conquest|At Sword's Point|Leave Her to Heaven|The Fifth Musketeer|The Greatest Show on Earth|Shockproof|The Naked Prey|Beach Red|Forever Amber|Road House`
The No.2 subquestion is `What are the main languages in the movies "California Conquest", "At Sword's Point", "Leave Her to Heaven", "The Fifth Musketeer", "The Greatest Show on Earth", "Shockproof", "The Naked Prey", "Beach Red", "Forever Amber", "Road House"?`,and the answer is `Based on the information given, there was an error in retrieving the data from the database. Therefore, I cannot provide the main languages of the movies listed. 

However, I can help guide you on how to correct the SQL query to avoid the syntax error. The issue seems to be with the apostrophe in "At Sword's Point". To fix this, you can escape the apostrophe or use double quotes for string literals.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT in_language FROM table_0 WHERE movie LIKE '%California Conquest%' OR movie LIKE '%At Sword''s Point%' OR movie LIKE '%Leave Her to Heaven%' OR movie LIKE '%The Fifth Musketeer%' OR movie LIKE '%The Greatest Show on Earth%' OR movie LIKE '%Shockproof%' OR movie LIKE '%The Naked Prey%' OR movie LIKE '%Beach Red%' OR movie LIKE '%Forever Amber%' OR movie LIKE '%Road House%'
```

Or using double quotes:

```sql
SELECT in_language FROM table_0 WHERE movie LIKE "%California Conquest%" OR movie LIKE "%At Sword's Point%" OR movie LIKE "%Leave Her to Heaven%" OR movie LIKE "%The Fifth Musketeer%" OR movie LIKE "%The Greatest Show on Earth%" OR movie LIKE "%Shockproof%" OR movie LIKE "%The Naked Prey%" OR movie LIKE "%Beach Red%" OR movie LIKE "%Forever Amber%" OR movie LIKE "%Road House%"
```

After correcting the query, you can run it again to retrieve the main languages of the movies.`

Based on the history information provided, I cannot supply the main languages of the movies starred by Cornel Wilde directly. However, I can guide you on how to correct the SQL query to retrieve the data.

SELECT in_language FROM table_0 WHERE movie LIKE "%California Conquest%" OR movie LIKE "%At Sword's Point%" OR movie LIKE "%Leave Her to Heaven%" OR movie LIKE "%The Fifth Musketeer%" OR movie LIKE "%The Greatest Show on Earth%" OR movie LIKE "%Shockproof%" OR movie LIKE "%The Naked Prey%" OR movie LIKE "%Beach Red%" OR movie LIKE "%Forever Amber%" OR movie LIKE "%Road House%"
```

You can run the corrected query to retrieve the main languages of the movies starred by Cornel Wilde.
